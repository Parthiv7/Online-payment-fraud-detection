# Online-payment-fraud-detection
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation for detecting online payment fraud using various machine learning techniques. Online payment fraud is a significant issue, leading to substantial financial losses for businesses and individuals alike. This project aims to identify fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns and anomalies in transaction data.

Objectives
Fraud Detection: Build and evaluate machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess raw transaction data to make it suitable for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Create and select features that enhance the model's ability to identify fraud.
Model Training: Implement and train various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and others.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Visualization: Provide insights into data distributions and model performance using plots and charts.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of online transaction records. Key features include:

Transaction Details: Type, amount, and balances before and after the transaction.
Metadata: Information about the sender and receiver.
Fraud Label: Indicator of whether the transaction is fraudulent or not.
Implementation
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and outliers.
Encoding categorical features and normalizing numerical data.
Feature Engineering:

Creating new features based on transaction behavior and historical patterns.
Binning continuous variables into discrete categories.
Model Building:

Implementing classification algorithms using libraries such as scikit-learn and imbalanced-learn.
Applying techniques such as Random Under Sampling to handle class imbalance.
Model Evaluation:

Using cross-validation to assess model stability.
Plotting ROC curves and confusion matrices to visualize model performance.
Results:

Presenting performance metrics and model comparisons.
Providing insights into which features contribute most to fraud detection.
